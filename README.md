# grayscaleVideoPlayer
The same as my json grayscale video player, but with binary files

So, yeah. JSON didn't work that well so I switched. And then I realised this uses a fuck ton of memory, so prepare for updates

## usage:
loads lvf (Lucky video file, creative I know) files wich you can encode from mp4 files via a tool i made: https://github.com/Lucky444/mp4ToLVFconverter
